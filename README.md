# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis

## Project Overview
A Pewlett Hackard manager has requested information concerning his retiring employees in order to help him prepare for the upcoming "silver tsunami". He is looking for the following:

1. The number of retiring employees per title.
2. The employees who are eligible to participate in a mentorship program.

## Resources
- Data Source: departments.csv, dept_emp.csv, dept_manager.csv, employees.csv, salaries.csv, titles.csv
- Software: pgAdmin 6.1, Visual Studio Code 1.59.0

 - Based on the image above, there are two signficant take aways:
      - The title with the most retiring employees is Senior Engineeer with 25,916.

 - The title with the most eligible employees for the mentorship program is Senior Staff with 569.

## Summary
In total, 72,458 employees will be retiring in the upcoming "silver tsunami" and 7 employee positions will be impacted by it. With only 1,549 employees qualifying for the mentorship program, it doesn't seem like there is nearly enough mentors for the next generation of Pewlett Hackard employees.
